Owl Gaming Platform
Owl is a revolutionary gaming platform that aims to redefine the gaming industry by introducing a decentralized approach to buying, selling, and owning games. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as TypeScript, React.js, Shadcn, and Solidity, Owl offers a unique experience for gamers, ensuring secure transactions, verifiable ownership, and the ability to resell games with reusable licenses.

Features
NFT-based Ownership
For every game purchased on Owl, users receive a unique Non-Fungible Token (NFT) associated with that specific game. Each game has its own distinct NFT, providing a secure and verifiable proof of ownership.

License Key Integration
With the NFT received upon purchase, users also gain access to the corresponding license key for the game. This license key is utilized to activate the purchased game, ensuring a seamless and controlled access process.

Blockchain Integration
Owl utilizes blockchain technology, specifically the Ethereum network, to push proof of transactions onto the blockchain. This enhances transparency, security, and guarantees that users never lose ownership of their purchased games.

Resell Option with Reusable Licenses
A unique feature of Owl is the ability to resell games that users have already bought. The platform supports reusable licenses, allowing users to resell their games to others. However, the number of resell transactions is limited, striking a balance between user flexibility and maintaining the integrity of the gaming ecosystem.

TypeScript: Owl is developed using TypeScript, providing a statically typed and scalable codebase for enhanced development and maintenance.

React.js: The frontend of Owl is built with React.js, offering a dynamic and responsive user interface for an optimal gaming experience.

Shadcn: Shadcn is used to implement the NFT functionality, ensuring that each game on Owl is associated with a unique and secure Non-Fungible Token.
